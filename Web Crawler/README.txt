READ ME- Homework 1

Zip files has the following files: 
1. WebCrawler.py - Crawler code
2. Home_Work_1.doc - Question 1
3. focussed_links.txt - list of urls for keyphrase 'information retrieval'
4. unfocussed_links.txt- all urls which are visited for unfocussed crawling 
5. README.txt - read me for home work 1

1. Instruction for compiling and running
   - Zip file comes with WebCrawler.py python 3 file, which has the crawler code in python
   - The crawler takes two arguments, first is seed url and other keyphrase as an optional argument. 
     Run the program: 
   -> For Unfocussed crawling
 	- > python3 WebCrawler.py http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Salton
   -> For Focussed crawling 
	- > python3 WebCrawler.py http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Salton "information retrieval"

2. Other files attached with the zip are: 
   i) Question 1: Solution to question 1
   i) focussed_links: This file contains list of urls where focussed crawl is done on keyphrase 'information retrieval'
  ii) unfocussed_links: This file contains list of all urls which are visited for unfocussed crawling without any keyphrase
  iii) Question 1 soln : Solution to question 1 

3. Proportion of focussed crawling with the word 'information retrieval'
  - Total pages visited during searching information retrieval from seed pages are, 4050 (number of visited URL's)
  - Total pages where keyphrase 'information retrieval' found is 142
  Therefore proportion is, 142/4050 so the ratio turns out to be 0.035
